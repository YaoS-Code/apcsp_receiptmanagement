# APCSP Receipt Management

This project is a Receipt Management System designed to help users manage and analyze receipts efficiently. The system allows users to create, search, and list receipts based on various criteria such as date range, type, and name. It also provides summary statistics for receipts, such as totals, averages, and more.

## Features
- **Create Receipts**: Add new receipts with details like date, name, type, description, amount, and tip.
- **Search Receipts**: Search for receipts by name.
- **Filter by Date Range**: List receipts within a specific date range.
- **Filter by Type**: List receipts of a specific type and view summary statistics.
- **View All Receipts**: Display all stored receipts.
- **Persistent Storage**: Receipts are saved to a file (`assets/database.txt`) for future use.

## Usage
1. Run the `Management.java` file to start the application.
2. Follow the menu options to interact with the system:
   - Create new receipts.
   - Search for receipts by name.
   - Filter receipts by date range or type.
   - View all receipts.
3. Receipts are automatically saved to the `assets/database.txt` file.
